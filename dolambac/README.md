# An interesting probability question

This is a simple, yet very interesting question posed by my dear friend Gokhan
Atinc.  

* The question and its solution may be found in the PDF
  [document](https://github.com/Symplectomorphism/miscellaneous/blob/master/dolambac/TeX/root.pdf)
  (if the first page is blank for some reason, click "Download" on the top right
  corner and open with system viewer).

* A companion Monte-Carlo simulation may be found under the Julia [folder](https://github.com/Symplectomorphism/miscellaneous/tree/master/dolambac/Julia).
