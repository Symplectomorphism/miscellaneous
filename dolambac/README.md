# An interesting probability question

This is a simple question posed by my dear friend Gokhan Atinc.  

* You can find the question and its solution in the PDF document
[here](https://github.com/Symplectomorphism/miscellaneous/blob/master/dolambac/TeX/root.pdf).

* A companion Monte-Carlo simulation may also be found under the Julia [folder](https://github.com/Symplectomorphism/miscellaneous/tree/master/dolambac/Julia).
