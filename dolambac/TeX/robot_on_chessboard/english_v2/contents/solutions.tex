\section{Solutions}
\label{sec:solutions}
%
We present two solutions to the problem: a probabilistic solution and a
reinforcement learning (RL) solution. The probabilistic solution will chase the
robot's possible motions as it tries to reach the goal state, computing all the
relevant expectations along the way. The RL solution will identify which MDP is
to be solved rigorously, and will attack the problem using a $Q$-learning
approach. It will need to keep track of two $Q$-functions as will be explained 
in the subsection that follows the next.
