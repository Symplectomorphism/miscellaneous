\subsection{RL solution}
\label{ssec:rl_sol}
%
We want to be able to programmatically solve this toy problem so that we can 
find the solution for any given initial state. We can use reinforcement learning
(RL) to solve this problem; however, to do this, we need to define our 
observation and action spaces as well as the transition and reward functions.
