\section{Experiment}

The simulation experiments we run in Gymnasium supports the theoretical
computation performed in Section~\ref{ssec:prob_sol}. The Monte Carlo
simulations that we perform can yield even more results, such as what is the 
expected number of ``bad'' moves that the robot makes before it reaches the goal. Here, a bad move means that the agent moves away from the goal. We can 
further compute a histogram of the states visited, and the rewards collected on 
average.

The first result in Figure~\ref{fig:running_avg} shows the running average
number of steps taken to reach the goal over $10,000$ independent Monte Carlo
simulation runs.

Figure~\ref{fig:running_avg} shows that the running average converges to $6.\bar{6}$ just as the theoretical computation indicated in Section~\ref{ssec:prob_sol}.

Figure~\ref{fig:histogram} shows the histogram of number of steps it took to 
solve the environment over $10,000$ independent Monte Carlo simulation runs. We 
observe that it takes $4$ steps to solve the environment $16.\bar{6}\%$ of the time, $6$ steps $33.\bar{3}\%$ of the time, and $8$ steps $50\%$ of the time, yielding an expected value of 
%
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times 4 + \frac{1}{3} \times 6 + \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = \frac{20}{3} = 6.\bar{6}.
\]

The final Figure~\ref{fig:visit_count} shows the frequency of visits of each
state under the optimal policy deduced by $Q$-learning over $10,000$ independent
Monte Carlo runs.
