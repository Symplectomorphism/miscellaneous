\section{Question}
Solve the following equation for $0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$.
\[ 2\cos{x} \left( \cos{2x} - 2\sin^2{x} \right) = 1. \]

\section{Answer}

Using the fact that $2\sin^2{x} = 1 - \cos{2x}$, we have
\begin{equation}
  1 = 2 \cos{x} \left( \cos{2x} - 2\sin^2{x} \right) = 2\cos{x}\left(2\cos{2x} - 1\right)
  \label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}
%
Next, we use the identity
\[ \cos{\theta_1}\cos{\theta_2} = \frac{1}{2}\cos{(\theta_1 + \theta_2)} +
\frac{1}{2}\cos{(\theta_1 -\theta_2)} \]
%
in equation~\eqref{eq:eq1} to obtain

\begin{equation}
  \cos{3x} = \frac{1}{2}.
  \label{eq:eq2}
\end{equation}
%
This means that  $3x + 2\pi k = \frac{\pi}{3}$ or $3x + 2\pi k =
\frac{5\pi}{3}$, for $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

\paragraph{Case 1}
\[ 3x + 2\pi k = \frac{\pi}{3} \;\; \Rightarrow \;\; x = \frac{\pi}{9}( 1 - 6k ). \]
%
Since $0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$, we must have that $k \in \{-2, -1, 0\}$; i.e., 
\[ x \in \left\{ \frac{\pi}{9}, \frac{7\pi}{9}, \frac{13\pi}{9} \right\}. \]
  

\paragraph{Case 2}
\[ 3x + 2\pi k = \frac{5\pi}{3} \;\; \Rightarrow \;\; x = \frac{\pi}{9}( 5 - 6k ). \]
%
Since $0 \leq x \leq 2\pi$, we must have that $k \in \{-2, -1, 0\}$; i.e., 
\[ x \in \left\{ \frac{5\pi}{9}, \frac{11\pi}{9}, \frac{17\pi}{9} \right\}. \]

\noindent Putting together the two cases, we have the final solution as

\[ \boxed{ x \in \frac{\pi}{9} \times \{ 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 \}. } \]
