Dear Professor Astolfi:

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, titled "Robust Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity-Based Control via Neural Bayesian Inference", by Wankun Sirichotiyakul, Nardos Ayele Ashenafi, and Aykut C. Satici, for consideration as a publication in the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. This manuscript has not been previously published and is not under consideration in the same or substantially similar form in any other peer-reviewed media.

This work focuses on the design of robust controllers for underactuated robotic systems. We develop a unified approach that leverages the mature theory of passivity-based control simultaneously with the flexibility of machine learning techniques. Stability is an intrinsic property of our approach, thanks to the incorporation of prior knowledge and the algebraic structure from passivity-based control. This is in contrast to most learning-based control laws found in the literature. Moreover, we integrate concepts from Bayesian inference to make our control law robust against uncertainties in parameters of the dynamical model. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulation and real-world experiments.

All authors listed have contributed equally to the manuscript. To the best of our knowledge, no conflict of interest, financial or other, exists. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. We look forward to receiving your comments.

Sincerely,
Wankun Sirichotiyakul, Corresponding author, wankunsirichotiyakul@u.boisestate.edu
